# Stata IE Visual Library

This repository contains graphs created in Stata to explore impact evaluation data sets and display results. The Library plots and codes can be viewed [here](https://worldbank.github.io/Stata-IE-Visual-Library/). The folders in the repository contain the `.dta` and `.do` files that can be used to replicate the images in the Library.


## Contributing

If you have suggestions of plots you would like to see in this library and are not currently here, you can open an *issue* describing your suggestion.

If you have some nice looking graphs you would like to add to this library and are familiar with how GitHub works, please feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request for any additions you want to make. Note that the folder structure used here consist of broad plot categories with individual folders for each plot. Each individual folder contains (1) the *de-identified* data used to create the plot and (2) the code that creates the plots from such data. `.png` files should not be loaded in these folders. The image will be added directly to the [GitHub page](https://worldbank.github.io/Stata-IE-Visual-Library/).

If you have some nice looking graphs you would like to add to this library and are not familiar with how GitHub works, you can send an e-mail to lcardosodeandrad@worldbank.org with a zipped folder containing (1) the *de-identified* data used to create the plot and (2) the code that creates the plots from such data.
